Sorry, I have not setup the README file just yet. I am working on it. 

If you somehow foun the needle in the haystack (my repo) and you want to play chess then try it out!

download this repo onto your machine, open up terminal, cd into the directory where you downloaded this repo and then in the terminal typ `ruby main.rb`

Come back later. I am in the process of making a detailed README for others to understand how I wrote this program and the logic going on behind the scenese. 

Thanks!
